# 📊 Crowdfunding Project Analysis

A data-driven analysis of crowdfunding projects to identify key success factors, insights, and trends — using platforms like Kickstarter as case studies.

##  Introduction

Crowdfunding is a modern approach to raising capital by collecting small contributions from a large number of people, typically online. Platforms like **Kickstarter** have revolutionized this space, allowing innovators to bring ideas to life with community support.

This project dives into Kickstarter data to uncover:
- What makes a crowdfunding campaign successful?
- What trends exist in funding, categories, and goals?
- How do visual tools (Excel, Power BI, Tableau) help present these insights?

## 📌 Problem Statement

Despite the popularity of crowdfunding, many campaigns fail to meet their funding goals due to:
- Poor marketing
- Unclear reward systems
- Unrealistic funding targets
- Lack of trust and credibility

**Objective:**  
To analyze successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns, extract insights on trends, and suggest growth strategies for future campaigners.

## 🧩 Data Modeling

To better understand relationships and derive structured insights, we applied **data modeling techniques** that involved:

- Identifying key entities such as `Campaign`, `Backer`, `Category`, and `Reward`.
- Establishing relationships between these entities to enable efficient querying.
- Creating **dimension and fact tables** to support data visualization in Power BI and Tableau.
- Modeling success factors like `Goal vs Raised Amount`, `Time Duration`, and `Reward Tiers` as metrics for analysis.

This helped in structuring the dataset for effective use in BI tools and in extracting deeper insights from complex data.
